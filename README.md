# Los Santos vs Los Angeles

Comparison of Los Angeles as shot in Goliath, Season 1 vs. Los Santos in GTA V

There is no doubt that the model of LAX in the game GTA V is fairly accurate. However, when I started watching Season 1 of Goliath on Amazon, I was blown away by other areas such as Vespucci and Vespucci Beach (Venice and Venice Beach), Del Perro Heights, and the Del Perro Heights Pier.
