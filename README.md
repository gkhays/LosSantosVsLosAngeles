# Los Santos vs Los Angeles

Comparison of Los Angeles as shot in Goliath, Season 1 vs. Los Santos in GTA V

There is no doubt that the model of LAX in the game GTA V is fairly accurate. However, when I started watching Season 1 of Goliath on Amazon, I was blown away by other areas such as Vespucci and Vespucci Beach (Venice and Venice Beach), Del Perro Heights, and the Del Perro Heights Pier.

We don't usually approach from the air in this direction, but this closely matches the Los Santos Freeway near the race track where Lester has a warehous.
